opencv-Python :
            OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications.
It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

-> OpenCV 1.00 released in 2006.

Computer vision :
    Image Processing − It focuses on image manipulation.

    Pattern Recognition − It explains various techniques to classify patterns.

    Photogrammetry − It is concerned with obtaining accurate measurements from images.

Applications :

    Robotics Application: 
        Localization − Determine robot location automatically
        Navigation
        Obstacles avoidance
        Assembly (peg-in-hole, welding, painting)
        Manipulation (e.g. PUMA robot manipulator)
        Human Robot Interaction (HRI) − Intelligent robotics to interact with and serve people

    Medicine Application :
        Classification and detection (e.g. lesion or cells classification and tumor detection)
        2D/3D segmentation
        3D human organ reconstruction (MRI or ultrasound)
        Vision-guided robotics surgery

    Industrial Automation Application:
        Industrial inspection (defect detection)
        Assembly
        Barcode and package label reading
        Object sorting
        Document understanding (e.g. OCR)

    Security Application:
        Biometrics (iris, finger print, face recognition)
        Surveillance − Detecting certain suspicious activities or behaviors

    Transportation Application:
        Autonomous vehicle
        Safety, e.g., driver vigilance monitoring
        Features of OpenCV Library

    Other applications :
        Read and write images
        Capture and save videos
        Process images (filter, transform)
        Perform feature detection
        Detect specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, in the videos or images.
        Analyze the video, i.e., estimate the motion in it, subtract the background, and track objects in it.
