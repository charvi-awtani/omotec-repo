# Setting up your computer

There are multiple ways in which we can set up your computer to code in python. But the few of the  recommended ways is to use Jupyter notebook or VS code. Other options include IDLE the pythons built in editor, Atom or PyCharm.

The reason we want to use an editor is to use the extensive features provided by them which include code auto completion, easy to run and see output and many more..

## Accessing Jupyter notebook inside VS code

Once VS code is installed and setup. We can directly use the jupyter notebook enviornment provided by VS code.

1. Create a new file.
2. From the dropdown select Jupyter notebook.
3. Try writing a single line of code 
```python
print("Hello world")
```
4. Use `Shift + Enter` to run the code cell.
5. A prompt will appear asking you to install the jupyter extension. Click yes to accept. *It usualy take about 5 min it to get installed*
